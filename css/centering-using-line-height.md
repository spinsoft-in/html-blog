## Using line-height

*   You can also use `line-height` to center vertically a single line of text inside a container 

```html
  <div>Hello</div
```

```css
 div {
    height: 200px;
    line-height: 200px;
 }
```

* That's quite ugly, but can be useful inside an <input /> element. 
* The `line-height` property works only when the  text to be centered spans a single line. 
* If the text wraps into multiple lines, the resulting output won't be centered.
